# [cybture](https://cybture.vercel.app/)
A collection of popular tool commands designed for quick and easy access during ethical hacking CTFs. Instead of struggling to recall commands or wading through extensive documentation, Cybture provides a straightforward solution to find the answers you need. This project was created to simplify command usage for my personal needs while deepening my understanding of the tools commonly used in ethical hacking.
### features
- one-click Command Copying: easily copy commands with a single click.
- customizable commands: input target IPs directly into pre-made commands for seamless customization.
- search (coming soon): quickly find tools or commands using keywords.
### challenges
honestly sometimes i felt that typescript causes more issues than it solves. react context api with asynchronous functions will also haunt me for some time now.
### whats next?
- expanding the list of tools with more in-depth research and useful commands, along with sufficient information to make them truly helpful.
- providing users with more input options beyond just the target machine IP
- implementing command generators and/or an AI helper to make the experience even more interactive.
